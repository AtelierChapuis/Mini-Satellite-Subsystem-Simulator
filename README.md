# Mini-Satellite-Subsystem-Simulator
Simulate a small satellite payload subsystem that handles sensor data acquisition, basic telemetry, and fault monitoring using STM32F746 Discovery board.
<br>
Bi-directional communication between laptop and STM32 board are handled through USART/USB and controlled via a python GUI app that acts as a Ground Control Station (receiving telemetry, updates, warnings, etc).
